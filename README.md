# Planning Poker Web Application

This is a **Planning Poker** web application built using **Java Spring Boot 3.4.2**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. It enables agile teams to collaboratively estimate the effort required for user stories using a fun and interactive card-based voting system.

## Features

- **Rooms**: Multiple teams can use the app simultaneously in separate rooms.
- **Custom Invite Links**: Each room has a unique invite link for easy access.
- **Live Updates**: Real-time updates ensure all participants see the played cards instantly.
- **Animated Cards**: Cards remain face-down until all players have played and are then revealed with an animation.
- **Player Status Indicators**: A sidebar displays the players in the room with checkmarks (‚úÖ) or crosses (‚ùå) to indicate if they have played their card.
- **Reveal Button Control**: The "Reveal Cards" button only becomes active when all players have played and is disabled after use.
- **Copy Room Link**: A button to easily copy the invite link to share with others.
